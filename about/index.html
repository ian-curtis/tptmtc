    <h1>About the TPTMTC Project</h1>

    <p>
      This website was born when I started collecting the Detroit Tigers team card rainbow in early 2025. During my search for the various parallels and variations, I got to stare at the image on the card for quite a bit. In the back of my head, I started to wonder where that picture came from and why it was chosen to be on the team card. At some point, someone on Reddit asked me if I knew from what game the picture was taken. I did a little research and, through some news photos and a short video, was able to find the exact moment that the card depcited. It was pretty neat, and that other Redditor agreed!
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I realized that others may want to know more about the images on their baseball cards. I knew I couldn't do it alone but I did have some moderate skills in building websites. So I figured I'd start somewhere and then rely on the amazing baseball card community to help fill in the gaps and do some of the research.

      Enjoy diving deeper in to your cards. Hopefully you'll find something cool!

      There will never be any ads on this site. I believe in ad-free browsing and internet privacy. I use no cookies or brownies or muffins or pop-ups or trackers or fish hooks or pesticides here. I've coded this site from the ground up (with a little help from Google) and I will not be ruining its pages with ads. This site is for trading card hobbyists to further their collecting enjoyment, not for making me money or selling your information.
    </p>

    <p>
      That being said, running this site is not free. It's not expensive either but not free, in terms of money, time, and effort. And the more traffic this gets, the more I might have to pay. At the bottom of every page there is a little (hopefully unobstrusive) coffee mug icon that leads to my Buy Me a Coffee page. This is NOT necessary to use the site. This is NOT expected or required!! I debated even putting anything here! Do whatever you please and please enjoy your hobby.
