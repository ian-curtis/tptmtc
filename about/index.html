    <h1>About the TPTMTC Project</h1>

    <p>
      This website was born when I started collecting the Detroit Tigers team card rainbow in early 2025. During my search for the various parallels and variations, I got to stare at the image on the card for quite a bit. In the back of my head, I started to wonder where that picture came from and why it was chosen to be on the team card. At some point, someone on Reddit asked me if I knew from what game the picture was taken. I did a little research and, through some news photos and a short video, was able to find the exact moment that the card depcited. It was pretty neat, and that other Redditor agreed!
    </p>

    <p>
      Then I realized that others may want to know more about the images on their baseball cards. I knew I couldn't do it alone but I did have some moderate skills in building websites. So I figured I'd start somewhere and then rely on the amazing baseball card community to help fill in the gaps and do some of the research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enjoy diving deeper in to your cards. Hopefully you'll find something cool!
